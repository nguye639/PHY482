## Assignment 1

Le, the confinment of plasmas is a very interesting and long worked on problem. There's no dearth of resources to review for this. I think given your papers, the L.A. Artsimovich 1972 article probabaly makes the most sense for you to start with. I did a little more digging and I think this paper on confinement parameters (https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1119/1.3096646) might also be quite interesting. It could lead you to more AJP article that flesh out details. In any event, you will want to decide if you want to do an overview of magnetic confinmentor get into some specific aspect. Either is fine.

Great work
