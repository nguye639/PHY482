In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 4

Le, this is a good start to your paper. Going forward, having a bit more on the the process of Ohmic heating as well the containment. While the general statements about how this works is useful, having more details on the experience of a single particle would be good. That would help us make sense of confinement more generally.

## Assignment 3

Le, great summaries again. "magnetic bottle donut." I'm dead. But you are basically correct. I think you don't have to dive into MHD unless you want to. There's a lot of analysis on how to contain a free electron in a magnetic bottle or donut. So you could present a simple model that convinces you and me that it's possible and then talk about how the plasma is handled in the literature. That's just a thought  for a direction to avoid you making this a thesis project. Great work.

## Assignment 2

Le, great summaries of these two papers. Given what you have written so far about your readings, I am wondering if a detailed paper on how magnetic confinement works in Tokamak devices is the right way to go. That will give you the space to read more about the mathematics of the models in the Artsimovich paper and to really try to understand all the aspects of the confinement process.  The second paper might provide a larger framing of what you are going to talk about in a paper. This is just an idea, so feel free to decide to do something different. Nice job.

## Assignment 1

Le, the confinement of plasmas is a very interesting and long worked on problem. There's no dearth of resources to review for this. I think given your papers, the L.A. Artsimovich 1972 article probably makes the most sense for you to start with. I did a little more digging and I think this paper on confinement parameters (https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1119/1.3096646) might also be quite interesting. It could lead you to more AJP article that flesh out details. In any event, you will want to decide if you want to do an overview of magnetic confinement or get into some specific aspect. Either is fine.

Great work
